### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

 Lab 5, part 1 was one of the more exciting labs. This lab took what we had created from previous labs, specifically lab 4, part 2. The reason it was so interesting to me was that it took in inputs from the user and was interactive. This was my first instance of creating a game and although it was not entirely from scratch, it gave me a sense of what creating a game on a larger scale would be like. These labs inspire me to continue learning how to code since I have always been fascinated with how these things work. I was able to learn and apply what was taken from the lectures about if else statements and standard character input/output statements to interact with the user as the end goal providing feedback when necessary. If all went well, the user was provided with hints if their guess needed to be higher or lower, or if they ran out of guesses then they would be prompted with a statement announcing failure and the revealed secret number.

* Lab 8

 Lab 8 took our understanding of loops to a higher level. By expanding our understanding of for-loops and counter-controlled for-loops we were able to repeat lines of code however many times we would need to. Nesting these loops inside one another allowed for a more complex yet more efficient use of loops to print characters to the terminal as we had done in lab 8, part 1. This part of the lab, in particular, was engaging for me because it felt more like a puzzle trying to find a way to print a certain amount of one character in the correct order so as to match it with the correct output. Brainstorming with my partner helped me broaden my understanding of the loop and we were able to optimize it after connecting the dots as we went along.

* Lab 11

 Lab 11 required us to use 2D vectors which are essentially a vector of vectors. We were given a 2D vector and were instructed to find a way to read out the individual elements of the vector inside the vector. This is especially present in the second part of the lab. We are tasked with identifying the California counties that the user is trying to look for and read out their population. There were multiple instances of catching errors when the user misused the program. This lab felt similar to lab 8 in the sense that it felt that it required one to think thoroughly. It was initially confusing to understand how to access individual elements of the vector of vectors but eventually, my partner and I were able to devise some code that was able to read this way using loops and function calls. I certainly took my time in making sure I understood that the code would work the way I intended.
