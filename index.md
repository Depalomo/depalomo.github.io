### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

   Lab 5, part 1 was one of the more exciting labs. This lab took what we had created already from the previous labs, specifically lab 4, part 2. The reason it was so was that it took in inputs from the user and was interactive; simply, we created a game. A guessing game that inspires me to learn more so I can develop something of my own.
